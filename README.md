# Toni Thomas – Developer Portfolio

A personal portfolio website built with HTML and CSS, designed to highlight my projects, skills, and career transition into front-end development. The current version includes a clean, responsive multi-page layout and one JavaScript interaction. This site will evolve over time as I continue to build and showcase new projects.
