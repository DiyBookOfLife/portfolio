# Toni Thomas – Developer Portfolio

Welcome to my original portfolio site — a personal project created to showcase my early work, skills, and transition into front-end web development. Built entirely with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, this site was designed to be a responsive, multi-page experience that demonstrates my ability to structure content, design clean user interfaces, and add interactivity using JavaScript DOM manipulation.

This project reflects my foundational knowledge in web development and served as an essential step in my learning journey. It includes custom styling, mobile responsiveness, and interactive elements such as a dynamic navigation system and personalized "About Me" content.

## 🔄 Project Evolution

As I continued learning and expanding my skill set, I created a **modern, component-based portfolio using React and Vite**, which introduces advanced UI/UX, reusable components, routing, and dynamic skill animations. I continue to update and maintain both versions to reflect my development progress.
